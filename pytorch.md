# Intro to PyTorch and Deep Learning!

## Traditional programming and Machine learning

Machine learning is making sense of data.

## Machine learning and Deep learning

In traditional machine learning, the learning process is supervised and the programmer has to be very, very specific when telling the computer what types of things it should be looking for when deciding if an image contains a dog or does not contain a dog. This is a laborious process called feature extraction and the computer's success rate depends entirely upon the programmer's ability to accurately define a feature set for "dog."

Computer programs that use deep learning go through much the same process. Each algorithm in the hierarchy applies a nonlinear transformation on its input and uses what it learns to create a statistical model as output. Iterations continue until the output has reached an acceptable level of accuracy. The number of processing layers through which data must pass is what inspired the label deep.
