## Get the code

```
git clone https://github.com/RITct/Intro-to-Machine-Learning-Workshop.git
```
</br></br>
## introduction to machine learning
Machine Learning is making sense of "DATA"!
</br>
Check out these blog posts toget a better intuition on machine learning

## Hack on ..

There are ipynb notebooks with code and explanation. </br> Open the .ipynb file notebook in desktop browser in github.</br>
Or install jupyter notebook.
```
pip install jupyter notebook
```
open terminal, go to the directory of cloned repository</br> 
then enter the command 
```
jupyter notebook
``` 
This window will pop up
</br></br>

</br></br>
Open the .ipynb file to view it.

## Tasks
</br>
In the first session of ml workshop we build a sentiment analyser using Naive bayes algorithm.
</br>
Here is a brief intro to naive bayes classifier. [check out](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/09/naive-bayes-explained/) to know how our classifier recognised positive and negative sentences !
</br>
## here is your first task
Check out the sklearn naive bayes [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html). We used Gaussian Naive bayes algorithm for our sentiment analyser.
</br>
## Reimplement sentiment analyser using other naive bayes alogrithms in sklearn. (i.e  Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes)
